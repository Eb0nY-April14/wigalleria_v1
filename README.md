# wiGalleria E-commerce Wig Store

This project is an e-commerce wig store app that was created using Python based Django framework. It is a fully featured app similar to all e-commerce apps out there with payment gateway that allows a user make payment but with test credit card provided by Stripe. A user will be able to perform full CRUD functionality i.e Create, Read, Update and Delete his data as well as making payment through the use of Stripe gateway API. The programming languages used for the development of this app are a combination of HTML, CSS (both bootstrap & custom) & JavaScript for the front-end and Python based Django framework for the back-end development. 

The purpose of this app is to allow a user purchase wigs and hair care products online in the comfort of their own homes without physically going to the store. Having an online wig store  eliminates the shortfall of store closing as it is on 24/7 except when store maintenance is taking place. The beauty and biggest advantage of building an ecommerce wig store is that it opens up a manually handled local business to a wider reach/audience worldwide so that it can be accessible for anyone to purchase wigs and hair care products from any location. 

The user interacts with the app through the GUI interface i.e front-end templates designed for each functionality such as add & edit products in the cart, view or delete products in the cart, view all products in the store & select the one(s) to purchase. There are role-based authentication system in place that ensures that different users can access different views i.e only registered/login/admin users can access certain views. An admin user will be the only one allowed to manage the store by interacting with the app through the front-end GUI interface & Django backend i.e perform CRUD functionality of Create, Read, Update & Delete products.  This store is protected with a very strong authentication system so that no unauthorised person will have access to its content.
